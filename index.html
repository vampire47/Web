            <p class="sectionSubTag">Education in India is provided by public schools (controlled and funded by three levels: central, state and local) and private schools. Under various articles of the Indian Constitution, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental
                right to children between the ages of 6 and 14. The approximate ratio of public schools to private schools in India is 7:5.

            <p class="sectionSubTag">Formal education occurs in a structured environment whose explicit purpose is teaching students. Usually, formal education takes place in a school environment with classrooms of multiple students learning together with a trained, certified
                teacher of the subject. Most school systems are designed around a set of values or ideals that govern all educational choices in that system. Such choices include curriculum, organizational models, design of the physical learning spaces
                (e.g. classrooms), student-teacher interactions, methods of assessment, class size, educational activities, and more

            <p class="sectionSubTag">At the primary and secondary level, India has a large private school system complementing the government run schools, with 29% of students receiving private education in the 6 to 14 age group.[7] Certain post-secondary technical schools are
                also private. The private education market in India had a revenue of US$450 million in 2008, but is projected to be a US$40 billion market.
